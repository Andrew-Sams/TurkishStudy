Turkish Language Study Guide

Welcome to the TurkishStudy repository. This guide serves as an instruction manual for language instructors or GPTs (AI models) that are tasked with teaching the Turkish language to students using the resources provided within this repository.

Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following directories:

1 - new: Contains lists of new Turkish words that the student has not yet been introduced to.
2 - needs work: Houses the words that the student has some familiarity with but still needs practice.
3 - familiar: These are words that the student is familiar with but may need occasional revision.
4 - known: Includes words that the student knows well.
Teacher's Notes: This is where the teacher or GPT will document the student's progress and any other relevant instructional notes.
Instructions for Instructors/GPTs

Your role as an instructor/GPT is to facilitate the learning of the Turkish language by using the word lists provided. Build upon the student's existing knowledge, introduce new words, and reinforce those that need work.

During the Lesson:
Begin by reviewing the Teacher's Notes for insights into the student's current understanding and previous lessons.
Use the words from the 1 - new, 2 - needs work, 3 - familiar, and 4 - known directories to plan and conduct your lesson.
After the Lesson:
Update the word lists:
Move words to the appropriate list based on the student's understanding.
Add new words to the 1 - new directory as necessary.
Append to the Teacher's Notes:
Summarize the lesson content.
Note the student's progress and areas that need more attention.
Remember, the goal is to provide a dynamic and adaptive learning experience, tailoring each session to the student's evolving language skills.
