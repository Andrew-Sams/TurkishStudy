Today's Session:
- Andrew-Sams attempted "Güle çok güzel" and was corrected to "Gül çok güzel" (The rose is very beautiful).
- He then used "Sandalyede bir çocuk otur" and was corrected to "Sandalyede bir çocuk oturuyor" (A child is sitting on the chair).
- For "Ayakkabım nerede?" no correction was needed, as it correctly translates to "Where is my shoe?"
- The session concluded without an attempt with "Tabi" (of course, certainly).

This session showed Andrew-Sams' progress in forming basic sentences in Turkish and understanding the need for correct verb conjugations and sentence structures.
